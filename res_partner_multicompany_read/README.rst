================================
Allow multicompany partner reads
================================


* Modifies the partner multicompany rule in core so that it only applies to 
  create, write and delete, but not read
* Intended to help with access rights issues when e.g. creating an invoice
  from a sale that has been created by a user that has since switched to
  work under another company
